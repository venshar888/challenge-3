Upon analyzing the log file, there seem to be several issues that could be causing the ongoing system attack. Here are the top 3 issues that need immediate attention:

Unauthorized access attempts: The log file contains requests for accessing sensitive areas of the website, such as /admin and /api, from unauthorized IP addresses. For example, the request "DELETE /admin/add_user HTTP/1.0" from IP address 33.186.140.139 was made with the user "Ken" who might be a hacker trying to gain access to sensitive information. These requests should be blocked, and access should only be granted to authorized users.

SQL Injection: The request "GET /admin/remove_product?id=drop+database+users HTTP/1.0" from IP address 41.40.53.253 indicates an SQL injection attempt. The "id" parameter has been set to "drop database users", which is an attempt to delete the database. This vulnerability can be fixed by implementing proper input validation and sanitization techniques.

Internal server errors: The requests "POST /purchase HTTP/1.0" and "GET /purchase/completed HTTP/1.0" returned internal server errors (500). These errors can be an indication of potential server vulnerabilities, and immediate action is required to identify and fix the root cause of these errors to ensure the website remains stable and available for customers.

To strengthen the website's security, it is recommended to implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block unauthorized access attempts and SQL injection attacks, ensure all server software is up-to-date, implement proper input validation and sanitization techniques, and monitor the website's access logs regularly to detect any suspicious  activity.
